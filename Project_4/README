## Image Processing Project 4


## Overview
- label card rank and suit

# Usage
- run 'image_capture.py' script
- upload folder of test images or select webcam option
- if webcam option chosen, follow terminal instructions to take a snapshot 
- ensure card is in fram with black background and clear features

# Assumptions:
- good enough quality to discern card rank and suit
- black background


## Algorithm pipeline

# Card Capture and Cropping (Aria)

# Card Classification (Nathan)


## Contributions

# Nathan
- Developed the Card Classification portion of the project, as well as integration of individual work
- Created rank and suit masks for use in card classification


## Requirements
- These programs were developed and tested with Python 3.9 and require the following third-party packages:

- opencv-python >= 4.5
- numpy >= 1.19
- matplotlib >= 3.3
