## Image Processing Project 4

## Overview

# Assumptions:
- good enough quality to discern card rank and suit
- black background

## Algorithm pipeline

- Created rank and suit masks for use in card classification

## Requirements

These programs were developed and tested with Python 3.9 and require the following third-party packages:

- opencv-python >= 4.5
- numpy >= 1.19
- matplotlib >= 3.3
